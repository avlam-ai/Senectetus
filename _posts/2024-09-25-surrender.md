Accept and want what is happening to you. 

The concept of **surrender**—accepting and embracing what happens to you—appears prominently in several schools of ancient philosophy, especially in **Stoicism** and **Buddhism**. Here are key writings and thinkers that explore this idea:

### 1. **Stoicism** (Greek and Roman Philosophy)
   - **Epictetus**, *The Enchiridion* (also called *The Manual*):
     - Epictetus teaches that we should focus only on what we can control, and that everything outside of our control (such as external events and the actions of others) should be accepted with calm indifference. He writes, "Do not seek to have events happen as you want them, but instead want them to happen as they do." This is a fundamental Stoic approach to surrendering to the flow of life.
   
   - **Marcus Aurelius**, *Meditations*:
     - As a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher, Marcus Aurelius’ *Meditations* reflect a continuous internal dialogue about accepting the present moment. He repeatedly emphasizes that we should "love our fate" (amor fati), aligning our will with the will of nature and the cosmos. One famous passage states, “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”
     
   - **Seneca**, *Letters to Lucilius*:
     - Seneca discusses how to deal with adversity in his letters. He advises accepting hardships and finding peace with fate, writing that "a good person dyes events with his own color and turns whatever happens to his own benefit." This aligns with the idea of surrendering to fate and turning misfortune into opportunity for inner growth.

### 2. **Buddhism**
   - **The Dhammapada** (Teachings of the Buddha):
     - The Buddha taught the principle of *anicca* (impermanence), which encourages a deep understanding and acceptance that all things are subject to change. The *Dhammapada* speaks about releasing attachments to desires and outcomes, and embracing the present moment without resistance. This is closely tied to the idea of surrendering to life’s natural flow.
     
   - **The Four Noble Truths** and **The Noble Eightfold Path**:
     - Buddhism emphasizes that suffering arises from attachment and resistance to the natural state of things. The solution, according to the Four Noble Truths, is to let go of this resistance and practice acceptance—essentially surrendering to the truth of impermanence and living mindfully.

### 3. **Taoism** (Chinese Philosophy)
   - **Laozi**, *Tao Te Ching*:
     - In Taoism, the concept of surrender is captured through the principle of *wu wei* (non-action or effortless action). Laozi advises that we should flow with life, rather than struggle against it. In *Tao Te Ching*, it is written, "The wise man is one who knows what he does not know and takes surrender as the basis of life." This reflects the importance of aligning oneself with the natural order, without forcing things or resisting circumstances.

### 4. **Bhagavad Gita** (Indian Philosophy)
   - The *Bhagavad Gita* teaches *karma yoga*, the yoga of action, which encourages acting without attachment to the fruits of one's actions. Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to surrender the outcomes of his actions to the divine will, stating, "You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions" (Chapter 2, Verse 47). This idea reflects a deep sense of surrender and acceptance of whatever happens as part of the divine plan.

These works collectively embody the idea of surrendering to the present moment, accepting life as it unfolds, and finding peace in aligning with the natural or divine order.
